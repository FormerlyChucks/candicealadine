# Adam LaDine LLC

Adam LaDine LLC is my private software development contracting/consulting service.

I have 13 years of coding experience, primarily with Python. I pride myself on writing code that is both flexible and bulletproof. I offer the following services:

* Script/bot development and hosting
* Static site development and hosting
* Full-stack dynamic site development and hosting

Work examples:

* Bot: [BotBust](https://reddit.com/r/botbust/about/sticky), a moderation assistance bot for reddit moderators, in use on over 650 subreddits. 
* Static site: This website, developed using Github's Jekyll/Liquid site generator. [Source files](https://github.com/captainmeta4/captainmeta4)
* Dynamic site: [Captain's Logbook](https://captainslogbook.org), a free hosting platform for creative writing, integrated with Reddit and Patreon. The stack is PostgreSQL/Flask/Gunicorn/Heroku. [Source code](https://github.com/captainmeta4/captainslogbook)

I work with the client to ensure that their design, documentation, debugging, and deployment needs are met. For quotes and business inquiries, please [fill out my contact form](./contact).


> I heartily recommend Adam as a freelance coder. I asked him to write me a project in Python, and he was prompt, professional, and wrote very clean, concise, and well-commented code.  
A+, will be using Adam again!
